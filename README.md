# EV_Demand_Forecasting
A novel method for estimating the future load associated to electric vehicles in distribution systems

**Prediction of variables related to electromobility}**

In the literature, various ways of quantifying the impact that electric vehicle charging will have on electricity grids have been studied. In \ cite {ref-1} the impact of the charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) on the network is investigated, emulating the typical use of vehicles considering the annual distance traveled by people and the energy consumption of the vehicles (distributed between the battery and the combustion engines). The result is the loss of the useful life of the distribution transformers produced by the energy load of the EV set.

** Methodology **

Under the literature, a methodology is presented that allows estimate the future energy demand related the charging of electric vehicles (EV) belong to a study area. The methodology uses a Monte Carlo model to obtain the energy associated to an electric vehicle fleet, which is spatially distributed through a linear regression model who estimate the number of existing electric vehicles per sector. The union of both models make it possible to obtain the energy associated with the EV charge for different locations inside the study area. The use of graph theory makes it possible to distribute the energy among the different primary distribution substations located inside the area study, result is contrasted with the forecast of daily energy demand for each substation. The study area selected is the city of Santiago of Chile and the locations correspond to their inside communes. The figure \ref{fig:metod} presents a diagram of the methodology used to estimate the energy demand.
