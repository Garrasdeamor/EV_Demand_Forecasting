A novel method for estimating the future load associated to electric vehicles in distribution systems

**Prediction of variables related to electromobility}**

In the literature, various ways of quantifying the impact that electric vehicle charging will have on electricity grids have been studied. In \ cite {ref-1} the impact of the charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) on the network is investigated, emulating the typical use of vehicles considering the annual distance traveled by people and the energy consumption of the vehicles (distributed between the battery and the combustion engines). The result is the loss of the useful life of the distribution transformers produced by the energy load of the EV set.
